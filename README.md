Hunting Licenses by State in 2023

The purpose of this application is to display the amount of hunting licenses issued by each state or territory of the United States in 2023 in an interactive choropleth map.

The data for this application came from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. It comes from their dataset "Hunting Licenses, Holders, and Costs by Apportionment Year" and it is available at the link provided in the map.

THe symbolization of this application is a choropleth map starting from light colors to indicate fewer licenses issued and getting progressively darker with an increase in licenses issued. I chose to represent this information in shades of green because it is the color with the most shades and therefore the most contrast between classes.

The design of this application is based off principles learned from lecture 9 of Web Mapping into the construction and styling of interactive choropleth maps.
